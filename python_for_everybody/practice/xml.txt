Import xml library:
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
Pass in xml how:
tree = ET.fromstring(data_string)
Search how:
tree.find('tag').text
Get an attribute how:
tree.find('tag').get('attr')
Equivalent of backtick string:
'''  '''
If there was an xml syntax problem, what happens:
Blows up at ET.fromstring
Will find() find all instances:
No, only the first
What to do to find all:
findall() returns a list
What do find and findall find:
The entire element, which why we have to specify the pieces we want with .get() or .text
Can we specify a path:
um, yes findall('root/parent/child')
