Why is python great:
It's libraries don't suck!
What does urllib do:
It does our network housekeeping for us.
Import what we need:
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
Instead of creating a socket, what do we do:
Create a handler
Do it:
fhand = urllib.request.urlopen(regular old url)
Then we can print it by:
Just like looping through a file handler: for line in fhand: print(line.decode().strip())
What don't we get with this simple little command:
No header/metadeta
Are they gone for good:
No, you can look up how if you want, but there is a way to display headers
A note: he didn't show us the parse and error methods
Noted
