Pros of a collection:
More than one value in one place, with addresses to get the value; think of a collection as being a variable that holds variables, but gives us awesome ways to manipulate the information, like sorting
What collections are there:
Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples
What type of thing is a List:
Collection
What is a List constant:
this_list = [some set of elements]
Is a List concerned with the type in its elements:
No, you can mix elements, including putting other collections as elements
Are lists mutable:
Yes
Are string mutable:
No
How can you easily construct a list of numbers:
list(range(int))
How can you tell the type of an element:
type(el)
How can you easily concatenate Lists:
list_3 = list_1 + list_2
How do you slice Lists:
lst[1:3]
How can you omit the starting index if it is start of list:
lst[:3]
How can you omit the ending index if it is the end of list:
list[1:]
How do you list methods of a type:
Instantiate the type: x = list() => dir(x)
What is the push method in python:
append
How can you get a total of the number of specific elements in a list:
list.count(desired_el)
While + concatenates lists and returns a new list, how can you add a list to the end of another:
lst.extend(lst2)
Find index of first instance of an element in a list:
lst.index(el)
Insert an el at an index in a list:
lst.insert(index, el)
Create a list out of a range:
lst = list(range(n))
What is a neat way to insert the elements of a lst into a lst:
lst[3:3] = [15, 16]
What is the pop method in python:
pop()
What does pop() return:
The element popped.
Get rid of an element in a list:
lst.remove(el)
Will remove() remove all instances of an el:
No, just the first
Turn a list upside down:
lst.reverse()
Does reverse() return the reversed list:
No, it is void and returns None
What does it do:
It reverses the list in place, meaning it mutates the actual list
When can you not sort a list using sort():
When the element types are mismatched
Get an empty list:
lst = []
Do it again:
lst = list()
How can you check if a list contains an element:
if el in lst
How can you check if a list does not contain an element:
if el not in lst
Are lists ordered:
Yes
Can a list be sorted:
Yes
What are the methods on List:
append, count, extend, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, sort
What kind of methods are they:
Instance methods
Does list have other built in functions:
Yes, it has Class functions
How are they called:
func(list)
Create a list from a string:
lst = str.split()
