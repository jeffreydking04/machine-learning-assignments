Why scrape:
Get data, Get data out of your own system that has no export capability, monitor a site, search engine
Be careful:
Some sites don't like it; don't republish copyrighted material, do not violate terms of service
What wonderful library do we love for scraping html:
BeautifulSoup
Why use the soup:
Because there are pitfalls associated with html scraping that are a pain to learn and deal with; soup handles that for use
Import the soup:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
How does it work:
Use urllib to get an html file => soup = BeautifulSoup(html_return, 'html.parser')
Get the anchor tags:
tags = soup('a')
Print the hrefs in the tags:
for tag in tags:  print(tag.get('href', None))
Can you pass soup encoded data (in other words, do you need to decode() your return):
You do not need to decode, soup knows how
