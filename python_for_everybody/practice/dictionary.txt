What is the equivalent of a dictionary in js:
Object
Does a dictionary have a length:
Yes
Create a dictionary:
dict = dict()
Check to see if a key is in a dictionary:
if key in dict or if key not in dict
Do a one liner that allows you to count instances with a dictionary:
counts[key] = counts.get(key, 0) + 1
Loop through a dictionary:
for key in dict:
list(dict) does what:
Creates a list of the dictionary's keys
What is another way to get a list of a dictionary's keys:
dict.keys()
How about a list of the values:
dict.values()
What does dict.items() return:
A list of tuples representing key and value for each dict items
Loop through a dictionary with both keys and values (this one is neat):
for key, value in dict.items(): (Remember that what you are really looping over is a list of tuples, but the variables correspond to the ordered pair of each)
