What does duplicated do:
df.duplicated creates a one to one boolean series that indicates whether the df passed in has any dulicated rows 
So if you want to just check a given column:
Only check that column
How can we do this with a parameter (obviously we could just call duplicated on the column) off a duplicated call on the whole df:
players.duplicated(subset=['Name'])
Which duplicate will return true:
The first found
What if you want the last:
df.duplicated(keep='last')
What if you just want to be rid of all duplicates:
keep=False
What command returns a df without the desired duplicates:
a = df.drop_duplicates()
You can use the keep parameter in the same way as above:
Yes
What dtype is a string in pandas:
object
Columns of different dtypes have what:
Different methods that can be called on them
What is a method on a object column:
str.split()
Method prefixes for datetime, category columns:
dt, cat
So str, dt, cat are:
Namespaces for the methods for that can be done on that dtypes
So if you want to split a column of strings by on a value, what do you get back df.str_data.str.split('-'):
A series of arrays
What if you want the arrays split into a df:
df.sd.str.split('-', expand=True)
There is a str method called contains; what wonderful thing can you pass into it:
regex, so remember that is how it is parsing the value passed
So we can use replace too:
Yes, and damn I need to learn more about regex
