Create a file pointer:
with open('filename', 'r') as fp:
What is the 'r':
I am assuming readonly
What is fp:
File pointer
How do we use it:
    for index, line in enumerate(fp.readlines()):  => print(index, line)
How can you get all the info you would ever need on a method:
pd.read_csv?
Can you read a remote csv:
pd.read_csv(url).head()
That method on the end should give you an idea about what kind of object you get back:
A df, baby
