What is data analysis:
A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.
What python library do we use for inspecting, cleansing, and transforming:
pandas
What are we trying to do:
Turn data into information (data is just data; information is decipherianing a true message the data conveys implicitly)
Are these words sacred:
No, we are just defining terms
In the end, what does a data scientist provide:
Useful reports, visualizations, and analysis tailored for the recepient (different departments might need different interpretations of the same information)
Advantags of auto-managed closed tools:
easy to learn
Disadvantages:
closed source, expensive, limited
Advantages of programming languages:
open source, free or cheap, powerful
Disadvantages:
git gud
Why python:
simplicity, intuitive, readable, the libraries rock, free, open source, great community
Why r?
r studio might be needed?, better at dealing with advanced statistical methods, more performant
What is the process:
get data, clean data, transform, modeling, go into, god forbid: machine learning, reporting, visualization etc.
Data analysis v. data science:
not clear, but data science is more rigorous, but data analysis is about communicating the results (no reason not to be able to do both)
Data analysis is:
Point and click
Data science is:
Abstraction
Data analysis is consistenly looking at:
Some visualization of the data
